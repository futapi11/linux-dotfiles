# Introduction
dotfiles for my arch install

# some notes
- I am no longer using helix, and the helix files is kept here in case I came back to it in the future. Rn I'm using a mix of vscode and neovim (depending on what's I'm doing)
- I'm using hyprland rn, but consider getting a floating window manager to go with it.

# Manual
I tried to automate stuff as much as possible, but some tasks are either tedious, buggy when automated or just outright impossble so I'll just quickly list some manual setup work here

  - Install [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) 
  - make a seperate exfat partition and mount it (if you have the space for it)
  - install the user.js file
